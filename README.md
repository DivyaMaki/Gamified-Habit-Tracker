## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16 or later recommended)
*   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running locally, or a MongoDB Atlas connection string.
*   `npm` (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gamified-habit-tracker.git
    cd gamified-habit-tracker
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your configuration:
        ```env
        PORT=5001
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
        ```
    *   (Optional) Seed the database with sample challenges and data. This is highly recommended for first-time setup.
        ```bash
        node seed.js
        ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory to point to your backend API:
        ```env
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
        ```

### Running the Application

You will need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   In the `backend` directory:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    *   The API should now be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    *   In the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   The React application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite).
